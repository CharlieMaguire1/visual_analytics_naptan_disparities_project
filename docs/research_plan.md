### Overview
This project examines the disparities between transport bus stops in rural and urban areas within the UK, using the Visual Analytics Process to gain insights through iterations. The main focus of this project will be stop density, stop types and the occurences of maintenance. 

### Methodology Used
- Schneiderman's Mantra will be used alongside the visual analytics process to update research questions. The stages include:
    1. **Overview** : Looking at the entire collection through all stages/processes
    2. **Zoom** : Looking at features of interest (relevance)
    3. **Filter** : Removing redundant features
    4. **Details-on-demand** : Iteractivity for the data items of interest
    5. **Relate** : Viewing and visualising the relationships between features/variables of interest.
    6. **History** : Using Jupyter Notebook to log the processes and save in a project sturcture for Github (https://github.com/CharlieMaguire1/visual_analytics_naptan_disparities_project)
    7. **Extract** : Choosing which visualisation and insights will be including in the final report.

### Research Question Evolution
- Initial Research Questions:
    - How do rural bus stops differ from urban bus stops regarding maintenance frequency, the density of stops, and stop type availability? And what factors help to predict
- Notes on Initial Research Question:
    - This research question is abstract, but can serve as a premise of the project. After the inital preprocessing steps (Overview, Zoom and Filter), it was feasible to divide this into more specific questions as a form of deduction.

- 2nd Iteration Research Questions:
    1. How is the distribution of Stop Types and Bus Stop Types differentiated between north and south areas and how do they influence the accessibility of public transport?
    2. What can be visualised about the frequency and timing of maintenance activities, as indicated by Date/Time of modifications, revision numbers and modification across different localities?
    3. How do bus stop densities and types vary across Admin area codes and how do these variations be visualised to identify region that are not been being served as much?
    4. What disparities exist between LocalityName, LocalityCentre, and their associated characteristics when visualised interactively?

### Dataset Source
